    <h2>Linear Equations</h2>

    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <div>
        <p class="a">ax + b = 0</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        where <span style="color:#bb0000;">a</span> and <span style="color:#bb0000;">b</span> are real numbers and
        <span style="color:#bb0000;">x</span> is a
        variable.
        This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not
        start
        off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span style="color:#bb0000;">x</span>, so don’t get
        too locked into always seeing an <span style="color:#bb0000;">x</span>
        there.
    </p>


    <h2>Quadratic Equation</h2>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

    <div>
        <p class="a">ax² + bx + c = 0</p>
    </div>

    <p>where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a ≠ 0.</p>

    <h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2>
    <p><span style="color:#bb0000;">π</span> (Pi) times the radius r squared:</p>

    <div>
        <p class="a">A = π · r²</p>
    </div>

    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span style="color:#bb0000;">D</span>)</p>
    <div>
        <p class="a">A = (π / 4) · D²</p>
    </div>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference <span style="color:#bb0000;">C</span>:</p>
    <div>
        <p class="a">A = C² / (4π)</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Intersection</h2>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <span style="color:#bb0000;">A</span> and <span style="color:#bb0000;">B</span>,
        denoted by
        A ∩ B, is the set of all objects that are members of both
        the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>
    <div>
        <p class="a">A ∩ B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B }</p>
    </div>
    <p>That is, x is an element of the intersection A ∩ B if and only if <span style="color:#bb0000;">x</span> is both
        an element of <span style="color:#bb0000;">A</span> and an element of <span style="color:#bb0000;">B</span>.
